# Jr SysAdmin Gauntlet - Linux

The following will be a list of tasks/challenges that are designed to give you an idea of some of the technologies/programs that are supported by Linux SysAds.

##### Advice:
* Work on your google-fu. We come across all kinds of programs and applications that we aren't always familiar with and have to look up information frequently. Use this as an opportunity to strengthen this skill without a production emergency.

* If you break something, GOOD! Learn from it and if possible troubleshoot it, work through it, and you will be stronger for it.

* PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE! The only way you will be more comfortable working on the command line is to consistently work on the command line. Reading is good but only takes you so far...

* If you are unable to perform a task due version/distro differences, can you explain why it is not possible?


##### Tasks:

1)  Hostname change.

2)  User/Group creation and SuperUser privileges.

3)  SSH hardening and obfuscation.

4)  Configuring software firewall rules.

5)  Installing, Starting, and Enabling security service.

6)  Installing a LAMP stack.

7)  Setting an Apache virtualhost and Document Root.

8)  Install Wordpress.

9)  Database service upgrade.

10) Setup MySQL replication.

11) Create a Self-Signed SSL Certificate

12) Configuring HTTP -> HTTPS redirect.

13) Install NGINX and configuring multiple web servers on multiple ports.

14) Modify PHP values

Extra Credit: In MySQL, create a database called "Playground". Add a table called movies with the following columns: "id | name | genre | year ". The id column should auto-increment. Add entries with movies you own. For example:

```
Select * from movies;
+----+------------------------------------+----------------+------+
| id | name                               | genre          | year |
+----+------------------------------------+----------------+------+
|  1 | Star Wars IV: A New Hope           | Sci-Fi/Fantasy | 1977 |
|  2 | Star Wars V: Empire Strikes Back   | Sci-Fi/Fantasy | 1980 |
|  3 | Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi   | Sci-Fi/Fantasy | 1983 |
