#LCCS Round 2

#Info:
#This is the first part of a small challenge series done for the LexicalScoped Community
#This is designed to practice and showcase our skills, while also demonstrating the diversity that can be found when multiple programmers attempt a single challenge.

#Limitations
#In order to keep the playground as simplified as possible we will be limiting things to the following:
#Language: Python 3 (up to and including 3.10)
#Operating System assumed will be Windows 10 (do not use system commands for other operating systems or you risk issues occurring)

#Part 2 Objectives:

#Without modifying the cards module you got from Round 1 results, create a High-Low-Same guessing game.

#Must contain a Function to perform card comparison.
#Must keep track of cards remaining and shuffle when we reach the end of the deck or shortly before (up to 5 cards before end of deck is acceptable)
#Must validate input is correct, if incorrect must re-request input.
#Must prompt after each round if you would like to continue playing or exit.
